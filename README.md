# Variable XP Death Penalty - Alpha 18

**Description:**

Changes the XP deficit you gain upon death as well as the maximum deficit.

By default, it currently does a 66% level deficit with a maximum of a whole level. This is balanced around my own co-op playthrough, but the values can easily be changed.

**Notes:**

Currently still says 10% XP lost regardless of how much you actually lose. I have to change localization to fix that, although TFP have it wrong anyway. It says 10% XP lost when you actually lose 25%.
