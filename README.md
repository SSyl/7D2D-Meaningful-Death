# Meaningful Death - Alpha 18

**Description:**

Changes the XP deficit you gain upon death as well as the maximum deficit. It also disables the stamina, hunger, and thirst regen that occurs after you respawn. Instead, you now respawn with 70 Hunger and Thirst. This stays the same, even as you level up, meaning the higher level you are the more you need to eat/drink in order to get back to full (although by the time that's a problem, you should already have a good source of food/water).

By default, it currently does a 66% level deficit with a maximum of a whole level. This is balanced around my own co-op playthrough, but the values can easily be changed in entityclasses.xml.

Why did I do this? Mostly because deying felt less like a punishment and more like a way to reset any negative effects you have.

Before this mod: Broken leg? Infected? Starving or dying of thirst? No worries, just die and respawn with no debuffs, full stats, and a smidge of XP loss.

**Notes:**

Currently still says 10% XP lost regardless of how much you actually lose. I have to change localization to fix that, although TFP have it wrong anyway. It says 10% XP lost when you actually lose 66%.
